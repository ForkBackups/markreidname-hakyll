title: Upcoming Conference in Sydney on Predictive APIs and Apps
excerpt: Spreading the word about the research track at the PAPIs conference that I am helping chair this year.
location: Canberra, Australia
---

After a big kick-off in Barcelona last year with [over 200 attendees][attend], 
the second [International Conference on Predictive APIs and Apps][papis] will be 
held in Sydney on the 6th-7th of August, 2015. 
The aim of this conference is to bring together people from academia, industry,
and government to share ideas and experiences around building apps that make 
use of machine learning APIs and services.

I'm very pleased to announce that I'll be the [Research Chair][team] for this 
year's conference and will help look after the [research track][] of the conference,
which will be running for the first time this year.
One of my jobs is to help get the word out the [Call for Proposals][cfp] that is
requesting submissions for review by **March 29th, 2015**. 

As described on the 
[Call for Proposals][cfp] page, the research track is looking
for proposals up to 8 pages in length that discuss techniques and problems 
encountered by those of you that create predictive APIs and services.
Topics for proposals include (but are not limited to): 

- Software engineering: design patterns and best practises
- Distributed systems: scaling out services and APIs
- Machine Learning / Data Science automation
- Interoperability between services / APIs / tools etc.

This new track aims to complement the tutorials and other presentations that will 
focus more on describing how predictive APIs and apps are.
Because of the [solid mix][attend] of academics, developers, and business people 
I think this will be a great opportunity to get your work in front of a lot of 
people who use this sort of technology on a daily basis.

As an added incentive, PAPIs will take place just before [KDD 2015][kdd], which
will run from the 10thâ€“13th of August. So if you are already planning on coming 
to KDD, consider coming a little earlier and attending PAPIs too.

Finally, it would be great if you could help me spread the word to anyone you 
think might be interested in submitting to or attending PAPIs. For example,
by retweeting or otherwise sharing the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Calling for proposals!

Let me know if you plan to be in Sydney for the conference and would like
to meet up. Hope to see you there!
