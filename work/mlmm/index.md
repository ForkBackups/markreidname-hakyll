# Composing Machine Learning via Market Mechanisms

The aim of this project is to build on existing relationships between certain
types of market making and machine learning in order to develop new ways to 
compose predictive technology.

The kind of questions I hope to answer include:

> 1. To what extend can pricing or other market mechanisms be interpreted as
>    learning algorithms.
> 
> 2. Can well-understood learning algorithms be used to create novel market
>    mechanisms? 
> 
> 3. How might we use market mechanisms to combine a variety of human and machine 
>    predictions to solve complex problem involving heterogeneous data?

Much of the work will be on the theoretical foundations of markets and learning.
This is driven by a number of striking similarities between the mathematical 
formalisms used to describe and analysis both cost-function-based market making
for prediction markets and certain online learning algorithms.
