I've been messing around with music for years in one form or another. This is a selection of tracks that I think turned out ok.

You can find more of my tracks on my [Soundcloud account](https://soundcloud.com/mdreid-1).

<!-- You (Amity Mix) -->

My [remix](http://reworked.nilsfrahm.com/rework/YOU/you-mark-reid) of Nils Frahm's beautifully spare piano piece that I did as part of his _[SCREWS reworked](http://reworked.nilsfrahm.com)_ project. (2014)


<!-- Piano Dub -->

This one started as a slow chord progression that lent itself to having a dubby atmosphere piled on. (2013)


<!-- Is it dangerous? -->

One moment I'm playing around with sidechain compression, the next thing I know I've put together a four-on-floor dance track! (2013)


<!-- Angular Touches -->

Another remix, this time for my good friends [The Neo](http://theneo.com/funk/). They were lovely enough to include my version as an extra on their _Seretonin_ album. (2003)


<!-- Lilli Pilli Drive -->

This older remix of [FourPlay](http://www.fourplay.com.au)'s _Lilli Pilli Drive_ is all over the place: an ambient beginning, a segue into some drum &amp; bass, and down-tempo ending. I had a lot of fun chopping and rearranging Lara's vocals. (2001)
