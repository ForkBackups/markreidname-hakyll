The international conference on [Predcitive APIS and Apps](http://www.papis.io/) will be held in Sydney on August 6-7th this year, right after KDD. 
I will be involved as the [Research Chair](http://www.papis.io/team). Please consider attending or, better yet, [submitting a proposal](http://www.papis.io/cfp). Hope to see you there!
