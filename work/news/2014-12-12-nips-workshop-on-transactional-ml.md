[Amos Storkey](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/) and [Jake Abernethy](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/) are graciously running our [Workshop on Transactional Machine Learning and E-Commerce](http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/ml/nipstransactional/) at NIPS this year. I'm really disappointed I will be missing the [fantastic line-up of speakers](http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/ml/nipstransactional/). [Rafael](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~raf/) will be presenting some of our joint work on [risk networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0413) there.
