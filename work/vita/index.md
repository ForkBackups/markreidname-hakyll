## Employment
  <div class="section">
### 2007--Present
* Research Fellow, _[Research School of Computer Science][], The [Australian National University][], Canberra_

> As part of the [Artificial Intelligence group][] at the [Research School of Computer Science][] I am investigating theoretical representations of and relationships between different types of machine learning problems. 
To date, this work has led to some deep connections between various notions of risk, information and divergences for binary classification problems as well as potentially fruitful connections to prediction markets.   
> 
> I have been contributed part-time to the NICTA machine learning group since July 2009.
>
> I am also co-leading the Linkage project _Protocols and Structures for Inference_ with Canon Research  to develop specifications for exposing machine learning algorithms as web services.

[Australian National University]: http://anu.edu.au/

### 2005--2007
* Senior Research Engineer, _[Canon Information Research Systems Australia][CISRA], Sydney_

> As a research engineer I have investigated, implemented, evaluated and applied for patents for novel machine learning algorithms which solve problems related to Canon's business interests. I have taken a primary role in three research projects and contributed to several others.
> During this time I have familiarised myself with research into ensemble methods, Bayesian inference, cost-sensitive learning, kernel methods, and spectral methods for dimensional reduction. Some of these techniques were evaluated on large, noisy, high-dimensional datasets.
> My other responsibilities include managing an undergraduate intern, presentation of machine learning papers to CISRA's journal club, various software engineering tasks and patent activities.

[CISRA]: http://www.cisra.com.au/

### 2004--2005
* Research Officer, _[Smart Internet Technology CRC][], Sydney_

> As a part-time research officer I developed a user interface for a handheld device as part of a technology demonstration for a mobile communications project. I also added some extensions to a Java messaging framework and audited it for J2ME compliance.

[Smart Internet Technology CRC]: http://www.smartservicescrc.com.au/AboutUs.html

### 2001--2003
* Senior Developer, _[Proxima Technology][], Sydney_

> During my part-time work at Proxima I developed various aspects of the company's flagship product: Centauri, an IT services monitoring and reporting tool. This included: researching machine learning approaches to predicting service faults; implementing a parser and interpreter for a language expressing service contracts; creating tools for automated building, testing and packaging; and instigating the use of a wiki for improved developer communication.

### 2001
* Co-Op Research Intern, _[IBM T.J. Watson Research][Watson], New York_

> IBM's Co-Op program employs postgraduate students to work full-time under a mentor on one of their research projects. 2001 was the first year the position was open to Australian students and I was one of only six successful applicants to be selected.
My work on this project resulted in a system which could build skill profiles for employees by analysing the collections of unstructured text documents they view or author.

[Watson]: http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml

### 1998--2000
* Resident Academic Assistant, _[Goldstein College][], University of New South Wales, Sydney_, 1998--2000

> My duties as a Resident Academic Staff member included: the personal and academic and support and development of College residents, liaising with University management, advising College management, participating in and developing the College social and cultural program and giving course and careers advice to residents.

## External Grants
<div class="section">
### 2013--2017
* Principal Investigator, ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA): _Composing Machine Learning via Market Mechanisms_.    
  Total Funding: A$289,000 over 3 years.

### 2013--2015
* Named Investigator, Australian Solar Institute Grant: _Machine-Learning-based Forecasting of Distributed Solar Energy Production_.

### 2013
* Member, ARC Australia-China Science and Research Fund Grant: _Machine Learning for Social Media_.    
  Total Funding: A$45,000 travel funding to visit Tsinghua University


### 2009--2012
* Co-Chief Investigator (with Robert Williamson), ARC Linkage Project _Structures and Protocols for Inference_. Linkage Partner: [Canon Information Systems Research Australia][cisra] (CISRA)    
  Total Funding: A$445,000 over 3 years (ARC + CISRA).

>  The aim of this project is to make it easier to get machine learning tools into the hands of people who work with data. To do this we plan to develop an inferential architecture for machine learning technology comprising protocols and data structures that allow the use and composition of a variety of software toolkits while avoiding the problems described above. The end result will be a means to use inferential technology that neither requires expert knowledge of the inner workings, nor the learning of a new language and API for each new toolkit.
