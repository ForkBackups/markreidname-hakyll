Exponential families are a well-studied class of parametric probability distributions that have a simple mathematical form which give rise to a number of useful properties.

One of the best non-technical introductions I've read on the topic is the chapter on Exponential Families in Peter Gr√ºnwald's book "The Minimum Description Length Principle" (2007).

Cosma Shalizi has a note on [Exponential Families of Probability Measures](http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/exponential-families.html) from which I pilfered some references.

   Puts foward a general theory of models that touches on exchangeability, alternative notions
   of sufficiency via repetitive structures. The discussion includes a reply by Phil Dawid that
   suggests connections with symmetry groups defining distributions.
